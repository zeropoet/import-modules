# Constitutional Field

*A bounded recursive ecosystem for competitive invariant formation.*

---

## Overview

Constitutional Field is a generative simulation engine designed to study how structure emerges, competes, stabilizes, and dissolves within immutable constraint.

It models a dynamically evolving system composed of:

* **Absolute Anchors** (constitutional invariants)
* **Dynamic Invariants** (single-species competitive agents)
* **Particle Flow** (finite resource substrate)
* **Oscillating Energy Field** (environmental modulation layer)

The system evolves through scarcity, territorial competition, nonlinear growth, and environmental forcing.

This is not a particle toy.

It is a formal laboratory for recursive structure under constitutional constraint.

---

## Architectural Layers

The engine is intentionally layered:

### Layer 0 — Absolute Anchors

Foundational invariants (e.g., `B`, `Ci`) that:

* Remain fixed in space
* Do not compete
* Do not consume energy
* Permanently shape field curvature

They define the constitutional geometry.

The system’s foundations cannot be overthrown.

---

### Layer 1 — Dynamic Invariants (Single Species)

Dynamic invariants are competitive agents operating within constitutional bounds.

They:

* Move along energy gradients
* Absorb finite resource from particle flow
* Compete territorially
* Grow nonlinearly
* Decay without intake
* Can dissolve

Each dynamic invariant maintains:

* `position`
* `energy`
* `strength`
* `stability`

Strength modifies curvature.
Energy determines survival.
Scarcity enforces selection pressure.

They are mortal structures inside an immortal geometry.

---

### Layer 2 — Oscillating Energy Field

The energy field is:

* Radial and angular
* Temporally modulated
* Smooth and bounded
* Globally balanced

Energy influences:

* Particle motion
* Invariant drift
* Local curvature bias

The field breathes without drifting.

Closure is preserved.

---

### Layer 3 — Particle Flow (Finite Resource Layer)

Particles represent distributed finite resource.

They:

* Move along negative energy gradients
* Accumulate in basins
* Provide intake to dynamic invariants

A global energy budget is enforced.

Growth is finite.
Scarcity is structural.

---

## Evolutionary Constraints

The engine enforces:

### Scarcity

A fixed global energy budget is proportionally distributed.

Competition is global.

No agent has infinite growth potential.

---

### Territorial Suppression

Stronger invariants reduce intake of nearby weaker ones.

Spatial dominance emerges organically.

---

### Nonlinear Growth

Strength follows a logistic curve:

* Rapid early expansion
* Asymptotic ceiling
* Suppression of runaway monopolization

Multi-pole equilibria become possible.

---

### Anchor Pressure

Dynamic invariants near constitutional anchors experience decay.

Foundations remain uncolonizable.

Structural corridors and ring-like ecosystems emerge.

---

## Emergent Regimes

Depending on parameter tuning, the system may exhibit:

* Stable multi-node equilibrium
* Rotating dominance cycles
* Migratory basin formation
* Competitive collapse
* Persistent critical churn

The engine operates across ordered, critical, and chaotic regimes.

Each regime is diagnostically meaningful.

---

## Formal Proposition

Constitutional Field operationalizes a structural thesis:

> Legible structure emerges from constraint under recursion and scarcity.

Structure arises through:

* Boundary
* Environmental modulation
* Finite resource
* Selection pressure
* Recursive reinforcement

Absolute reference remains fixed.

Dynamic authorship unfolds within it.

The architecture is dimensionally extensible.

Future expansions may include:

* 3D projection
* Species differentiation
* Energy conservation enforcement
* Meta-invariant evolution
* Phase diagram mapping of parameter regimes

Single-species competition remains the current focus to preserve clarity.

---

## Current Stage

* Constitutional anchors: immutable
* Dynamic invariants: competitive and mortal
* Energy field: oscillating
* Resource layer: finite
* Selection pressure: active

The system is constitutionally stable and evolutionarily expressive.

## Intent

This project formalizes a translation pipeline:

Concept → Constraint Model → Field Simulation → Emergent Topology

It is a reproducible architecture for studying how invariants attempt to exist within bounded recursive systems.

Recursive authorship is implemented algorithmically.

---

## Closing

Constitutional Field is not an aesthetic generator.

It is a structural instrument.

A bounded recursive ecosystem.

A constitutional geometry under selective pressure.

A machine for observing how invariants compete to persist.
