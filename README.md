# Constitutional Field

*A bounded recursive ecosystem operating within a deterministic constitutional manifold.*

---

## Overview

Constitutional Field is a generative simulation engine for studying how dynamic structures emerge, compete, stabilize, and dissolve within immutable constraint.

It extends the Constitutional Sigil from a static manifold into a living laboratory.

Where the Sigil defines the law,
Constitutional Field studies what attempts to persist inside it.

This is not a particle toy.

It is a structural instrument for recursive invariant formation under scarcity and constraint.

## Constitutional Substrate

At its foundation lies a seeded, deterministic constitutional manifold:

[
F_{seed}
]

The seed defines:

* Harmonic structure
* Angular symmetry
* Anchor curvature influence
* Boundary domain

For a given seed:

* The constitutional geometry is reproducible
* The structure is archivable
* The law does not drift during runtime

The constitution remains fixed.

Only dynamic structures evolve.

---

## Completed Development Stages

The engine has progressed through five implemented structural stages:

### Stage 1 — Closure

The field is defined over a finite circular domain.

Boundary conditions are enforced.

The system is closed and bounded.

---

### Stage 2 — Oscillating Energy

A smooth, bounded oscillating energy field modulates environmental forcing:

[
E(r,\theta,t)
]

The field evolves temporally without breaking structural closure.

---

### Stage 3 — Basin Detection

Local curvature wells are detected dynamically.

Basins emerge from harmonic structure and anchor interaction.

These basins form the substrate for invariant stabilization.

---

### Stage 4 — Emergent Promotion

Regions of sustained energy accumulation promote dynamic invariants.

Invariant formation is not injected.
It emerges from basin persistence.

Promotion is conditional, not arbitrary.

---

### Stage 5 — Competitive Ecosystem & Selection Pressure

Dynamic invariants operate under:

* Finite global energy budget
* Territorial suppression
* Nonlinear growth constraints
* Decay under scarcity

Competition is structural.

No invariant has infinite growth potential.

Selection pressure is enforced globally.

## Architectural Layers

### Layer 0 — Absolute Anchors

Fixed invariants ( A_i ):

[
\frac{dA_i}{dt} = 0
]

They:

* Do not move
* Do not decay
* Permanently shape curvature

They represent constitutional constraint.

---

### Layer 1 — Dynamic Invariants (Single Species)

Dynamic invariants ( I_j ) evolve according to:

**Gradient Motion**
[
\frac{d\mathbf{x}_j}{dt} = -\nabla E(\mathbf{x}_j, t)
]

**Energy Intake Under Scarcity**
[
E_j(t+1) = E_j(t) + \frac{I_j}{\sum_k I_k} \cdot B - \delta
]

Where:

* ( I_j ) = local intake
* ( B ) = global energy budget
* ( \delta ) = decay constant

**Nonlinear Strength Growth**
[
S_j = S_{max} \cdot \frac{E_j}{1 + E_j}
]

Dynamic invariants are mortal.

They exist conditionally within law.

---

### Layer 2 — Density Field

Total curvature is:

[
D(\mathbf{x}, t) =
\sum_i S_i \cdot e^{-k |\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i|}
]

Absolute anchors contribute constant curvature.

Dynamic invariants contribute variable curvature.

The manifold deforms under competitive pressure.

---

## Global System Definition

[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\text{Motion:} &\quad \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = -\nabla E \
\text{Scarcity:} &\quad \sum_j \Delta E_j = B \
\text{Growth:} &\quad S = \frac{S_{max}E}{1+E} \
\text{Decay:} &\quad E \rightarrow E - \delta \
\text{Anchors:} &\quad \frac{dA}{dt} = 0
\end{aligned}
}
]

This enforces:

* Boundary
* Deterministic constitution
* Environmental modulation
* Finite resource
* Selection pressure
* Recursive reinforcement

## Relationship to Constitutional Sigil

Constitutional Sigil defines the static manifold in dual projection (2D canonical, 3D elevation).

Constitutional Field introduces dynamic competition inside that same seeded manifold.

Sigil expresses the law.
Field studies persistence within the law.

Both share the same constitutional substrate.

---

## Emergent Regimes

Depending on parameter tuning and seed:

* Stable multi-node equilibrium
* Rotating dominance cycles
* Migratory basin formation
* Competitive collapse
* Persistent critical churn

The engine spans ordered, critical, and chaotic regimes.

All behavior remains bounded by the constitution.

---

## Intent

Concept → Constraint → Field → Promotion → Competition → Selection → Emergence

Constitutional Field operationalizes the thesis:

> Legible structure emerges from constraint under recursion and scarcity.

The constitution does not adapt.

Dynamic structures must negotiate it.

---

## Closing

Constitutional Field is a recursive ecosystem inside a deterministic geometry.

The law is stable.

Scarcity is real.

Selection is structural.

Only what can persist under constraint remains.
